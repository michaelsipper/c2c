            <p>
                The world produces an unprecedented volume of waste, a by-product of our relentless industrial endeavors and consumerism. While waste is often associated with negativity and discard, it is, in reality, an untapped reservoir of potential resources. The linear process of "produce, consume, dispose" lacks transparency and efficiency. What if we transform waste management and repurposement to operate at the speed and scale of the global digital ecosystem? Enter â€œC to C" - envisioning a future where waste becomes a strategic asset. This initiative seeks to establish a decentralized, transparent marketplace powered by blockchain to transform waste into a valuable commodity. Just as cryptocurrencies revolutionized the financial world, Circular Chain intends to redefine the value of waste, driving the next era of sustainable, circular economy.
