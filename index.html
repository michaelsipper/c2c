        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>The internet is the most powerful creative tool in history. Creative works are connected,
            remixed, and distributed at zero marginal cost.</p>
        <p>Despite the abundance of content creation on the internet, creators struggle to grow and
            capture the value of their intellectual property. The traditional IP model is both opaque
            and slow. Provenance and attribution need to happen at the speed and scale of the web.</p>
        <p>By creating an IP framework that embraces the internet's fundamental principles of
            openness and collaboration, Story Protocol aims to become the native IP infrastructure of
            the internet. The protocol will provide a neutral source of provenance to track the lifecycle
            of an IP as it evolves across mediums and platforms in addition to modules that power
            frictionless licensing and remixing of IP.</p>
        <p>Just as Git revolutionized the development of open-source software by underpinning the
            networked evolution of code, Story Protocol aims to transform the development of creative IP.</p>
